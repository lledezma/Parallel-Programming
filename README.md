# Parallel-Programming
This repository contains parallel programming files that use different APIs like; CUDA, Opencl, OpenMP, OpenMPI and Posix Threads. 

Programs:
- Matrix Multiplication.
- Array Addition.
- Pattern Match (naive algorithm and Boyer Moore algorithm).
- Finding the minimum value using Prefix Sum Logic.
- Finding constant e (Euler's number).
- Converting an image to a grayscale image.
- Computing Monte Carlo method.
- Numerical Integration to find pi.

Experiments and tests:
- OpenCL event profiling is used to test performance and time execution of kernels.
- We test the use of multithreading to run multiple OpenCL kernels with different devices at the same time.
