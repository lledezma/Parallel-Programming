# Parallel-Programming
This repository contains parallel programming files that use different APIs like; CUDA, Opencl, OpenMP, and Posix Threads. 
Programs:
  *Matrix Multiplication.
  *Array Addition.
  *Pattern Match (naive algorithm and Boyer Moore algorithm).
  *Finding the minimum value using Prefix Sum Logic.
  *Finding constant e (Euler's number).
  *Converting an image to a grayscale image.
  *Computing Monte Carlo method.
  *Numerical Integration to find pi.
